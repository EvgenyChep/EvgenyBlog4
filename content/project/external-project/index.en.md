Project presentation: Models of two competing firms


The project at every stage is presented in the form of a presentation. The presentation time is 2â€“5 minutes.


Stages of project presentation


1. Model. Presentation on a scientific problem. Theoretical description
tasks. Description of the model.


2. Algorithms. Presentation on algorithms for solving the problem.


3. Complexes of programs. Description of the software implementation of the project.


4. Project defense. Collective discussion of the project result, self-assessment of activities.


Results:


To build a model of competition between two firms, we considered the model of one firm


We selected algorithms for the solution and obtained the dynamics of changes in sales volumes


We implemented the project programmatically.
