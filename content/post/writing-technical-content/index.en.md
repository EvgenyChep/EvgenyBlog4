  The automated control system of the Strategic Missile Forces consists of two independent, but interfaced elements: the automated combat control system (ASBU) and the information and settlement system (IRS).

ASBU ensures the transmission of control information in the interests of centralized combat control (orders, signals, orders, reports) in any conditions of the situation.

IRS provides information and calculation needs of command and control bodies and posts both by solving combat command and control tasks, including planning the combat use of the Strategic Missile Forces, providing combat command, maintaining combat readiness of units and subunits, operating weapons and combat command and control and communications equipment, and daily command and control tasks. activities, including assessment of the state of the troops, technical and logistical support, long-term planning and development of troops, capital construction, organizational and mobilization planning and personnel accounting, planning of daily activities and monitoring the implementation of plans, orders and directives.



### Fifth generation of the Strategic Missile Forces ACS

  In August 2014, the United Instrument-Making Corporation presented the fifth generation automated control system for the Strategic Missile Forces. According to the company, the system is built entirely on the domestic electronic component base and differs from the previous system in a fundamentally different layout of the operator's workstation.

With the help of the new AWP, the operator will be able from one point not only to control the combat system, but also to solve various information tasks: for example, to receive orders, compose and send reports. The fifth generation system is more ergonomic, has an improved intelligent and user-friendly software interface, the developers note. All these innovations should significantly simplify the operator's work.
